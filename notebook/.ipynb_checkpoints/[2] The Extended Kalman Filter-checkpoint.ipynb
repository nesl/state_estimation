    "# Tutorial #2 :: The Extended Kalman Filter\n",
    "The Kalman filter (and the Extended Kalman Filter) is an incredibly powerful estimation technique. We will begin by describing the linear Kalman filter (this is what is meant when we say \"Kalman filter\" as opposed to \"Extended\" or \"Unscented\" Kalman filters), and then we'll show how this can be extended to nonlinear cases via the extended Kalman filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman filter, though it does act as a filter, is most useful as a state estimation technique. In fact, given a linear system where the state variables are zero-mean and Gaussian distributed, the Kalman filter is an optimal estimator. We'll provide some rough math below to give some intuition into the code that will follow, but for a more complete understanding of Kalman filters and linear estimation in general, see *Adaptive Filters*, by Ali Sayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin! \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Normal Equation for Optimal Linear Estimation\n",
    "Linear estimation deals with estimating a random, possibly vector-valued variable $x$ given observations $y$. By default, we assume a vector-valued quantity is a column vector. Traditionally, these estimators are designed to be optimal in the *least squares sense*. In other words, they aim to minimize the error\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$\\tilde{x} = x - \\hat{x}$</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{x}$ is the estimate of vector $x$. The *mean-squared-error* or MSE of $\\tilde{x}$ is given as $\\mathbb{E}(\\tilde{x}^2)$. One intuitive way of reasoning about $\\hat{x}$ is that it must be constructed in such a way that $\\tilde{x}$ is uncorrelated with observations $y$ or any function thereof, say $f(y)$. If $\\tilde{x}$ *was* correlated with $y$, then additional information could still be gleaned from $y$, indicating that $\\hat{x}$ is suboptimal. More formally, the following condition must hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$\\tilde{x} \\perp f(y) = \\hat{x}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "using the simple observation that $\\hat{x}$ is a function of $y$. This is commonly stated as the *orthognality principle*, because it implies that $\\mathbb{E}\\tilde{x}f(y)^* = 0$ for complex valued $x$ and $y$, or simply $\\mathbb{E}\\tilde{x}f(y)^T = 0$ for real values. Finally, it can be derived from probability that the optimal estimate of $\\hat{x} = f(y)$ given observations $y$ is the conditional expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> $\\hat{x} = \\mathbb{E}(x~|~y)$ </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear estimation limits $f(y)$ to be a liniear function, namely\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> $f(y) = Ky + b$ </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "for matrix $K$ and vector $b$. More specifically, we often assume zero-mean random variables $x$ and $y$ such that $\\hat{x} = f(y) = Ky$. Given the orthogonality principle, the following must hold for an optimal estimator, denoted $K_o$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}(\\tilde{x}y^T) &= 0\\\\\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}((x - K_oy)y^T) &= 0\\\\\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}(xy^T) - K_o\\mathbb{E}(yy^T) &= 0\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "or, more compactly,\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$K_oR_y = R_{xy}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R_{xy}$ represents the covariance matrix corresponding to random variables $x$ and $y$. The above equation is often referred to as the normal equation for optimal linear estimation. In summary, an optimal linear estimator $K_o$ is any such matrix that satisfies $K_o = R_y^{-1}R_{xy}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing the Linear Kalman Filter\n",
    "We know from the previous section that we're seeking an optimal estimator $K_o$ such that $\\hat{x} = K_oy$, where $K_oRy = R_{xy}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to consider a transformation on $y$ into a new variable $e$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$e = Ay$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "for a lower triangular and invertible matrix $A$. The key is that we want each subsequent entry in the vector $e$ to be uncorrelated with the previous entry. In other words, we want to extract from $y$ the key information from all observations, ignoring any cross-correlation. These are called *innovations* of $y$. In other words, we want $R_e$ to be diagonal. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are now concerned with estimating $x$ from $e$: $\\hat{x}_{|e} = R_{xe}R_e^{-1}e$. In fact, we can show algebraically that the estimators are equivalent--that is, estimating $\\hat{x}$ from $e$ is the same as estimating $\\hat{x}$ from $y$, but now $R_e$ is block diagonal, meaning it can nicely be split into a sum of individual estimators! In fact, we can write the following iterative formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{x}_{|N} &= \\hat{x}_{|N-1} + \\hat{x}_{e_N}\\\\\n",
    "&= \\hat{x}_{|N-1} + (\\mathbb{E}xe^T_N)R_{e,N}^{-1}e_N\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{x}_{|N}$ denotes the estimate of $x$ using only up to $N$ observations $y$. At this point we have an iterative, causal way of estimating $\\hat{x}$, but we haven't yet explained how to get the innovations $e$ from $y$--we've just assumed they exist. In fact, we can construct each innovation $e_i$ by *whitening* the observations $y$: $e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_{i|i-1}$. We'll not dig into the details here, referring the reader again to *Adaptive Filters* by Sayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## State-Space Models\n",
    "In order to understand Kalman filters, we must first understand state-space representations. State-space models describe the iterative progression of the state, $x$, as well as the observations $y$ as a function of the state. Specifcally, we often write\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "x_{k+1} &= F_kx_k + B_ku_k + w_k \\\\\n",
    "z_{k} &= H_kx_k + v_k\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is the discrete time index, $u$ is the input to the system, and $F$, $B$, and $H$ describe the evolution of the state and the observations--these depend on the physics of the system and the sensors used. Note that the matrices themselves *can* vary with time as well, although they certainly don't have to. Finally, $w_k$ and $v_k$ *must* be zero-mean and white. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Kalman Filter Equations\n",
    "Here we skip forward *a lot* in the derivation of the Kalman filter, skipping straight to the recursion equations themselves. I hope to fill this material in later, but for now the reader will have to take these equations on faith. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a linear model described in state-space format, and given state variables $x$ and observations $y$ as discussed, the Kalman filter recursion is as folllows, adopting the notation used by Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with a prediction stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{x}_{k|k-1} &= F_k\\hat{x}_{k-1|k-1} + B_ku_k \\\\\n",
    "P_{k|k-1} &= F_kP_{k-1|k-1}F_k^T + Q_k\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_k$ is the state covariance matrix and $Q_k$ is the process covariance matrix. $P_k$ describes the current uncertainty of any of the given state variables at time $k$ as well as their cross-covariance terms with regard to other state variables. Small elements of $P_k$ indicate accurate state variable estimates. $Q_k$ is often a diagonal matrix whose elements dictate the variance in the sensor measurements--e.g. accelerometer or gyroscope variance due to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have an update stage:\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\tilde{y}_k &= z_k - H_k\\hat{x}_{k|k-1}\\\\\n",
    "S_k &= H_kP_{k|k-1}H_k^T + R_k \\\\\n",
    "K_k &= P_{k|k-1}H_k^TS_k^{-1} \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{x}_{k|k} &= \\hat{x}_{k|k-1} + K_k\\tilde{y}_k \\\\\n",
    "P_{k|k} &= (I - K_kH_k)P_{k|k-1}\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S_k$ is the covariance matrix of the innovation terms, $e$, and $K_k$ is called the Kalman *gain* and dictates how the state is advanced as a function of each prediction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These equations are set in stone, so as a designer what must you decide upon for your application-specific Kalman filter? A designer must do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Decide the variances embedded in the measurement covariance matrix $R$\n",
    "2.  Decide the variances embedded in the process covariance matrix $Q$. \n",
    "3.  Design the state transition matrix $F$, any feed forward matrix $B$ (often zero), and the measurement matrix $H$. \n",
    "4. Decide on the initial uncertainty of all state variables, $P_{k=0}$ as well as the initial state estimate itself, $x_{k=0}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the system is not often linear, and even if it is designing the linear matrices to best represent the dynamics of your system can be difficult.  Enter the Extended Kalman Filter, or EKF. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Extended Kalman Filter\n",
    "The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) does not benefit from the same optimality guarantees that the linear Kalman filter does--that is, it's not provably optimal, or at least has yet to be proven optimal. Nevertheless, it is an incredibly powerful tool that performs admirably even with nonlinear systems.  Just because we have yet to *prove* that it's optimal should not dissuade you from using it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is very simple--we take the same Kalman filter equations, but where we require linear dynamic matrices such as $F$ and $K$ we instead *create* these matrices by linearizing about the current state estimate. In fact, we can write our code such that we need only provide function handles to our EKF rather than a matrix at all! This undoubtedly adds to computation time, but it can be very convenient for quickly designing very powerful state estimation code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than re-write the Kalman filter equations here, we will instead write the EKF as pseudocode, where it is assumed that matrix multiplication is allowed. First, the developer must design a process and a measurement function:\n",
    "\n",
    "`fstate` predicts the next state from the current state. For example, you might predict the future position of an object based on its current position and its current velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "`fmeas` predicts the observation vector $z$ based on the current state estimate. For example, you might have a measurement that consists of the distance between two objects, both who have positions tracked in your state vector. You can predict this range based on your current estimate of their two positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The EKF equations can then be written as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x1,A]=linearize(fstate,x);   \n",
    "P=A*P*A'+Q;                \n",
    "[z1,H]=linearize(fmeas,x1);    \n",
    "P12=P*H';                   \n",
    "K=P12*inv(H*P12+R);      \n",
    "x=x1+K*(z-z1);           \n",
    "P=P-K*P12';             \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the `linearize` function can be done a number of ways. One generalizabel way uses the addition of *very* small complex numbers to evaluate the gradient (i.e. find the Jacobian) of a function with respect to a given state, $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "% Linearization through complex step differentiation\n",
    "function [z,A]=linearize(fcn,x)\n",
    "    z=fcn(x);\n",
    "    n=length(x);\n",
    "    m=length(z);\n",
    "    A=zeros(m,n);\n",
    "    h=n*eps;\n",
    "    for k=1 to n\n",
    "        x1=x;\n",
    "        x1(k)=x1(k)+h*i;\n",
    "        A(:,k)=imag(fun(x1))/h;\n",
    "    end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `eps` is a very small number, $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, and `imag` extracts the imaginary component of a complex number. \n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example of the EKF in Action\n",
    "First, let's define a couple of functions to help us with our EKF estimation filter, as per the pseudocode written above, which was largely adopting Matlab's syntax.\n"

This keeps things from diverging too drastically. \n",
